The APIs is kept fairly simple and follows the PDF-32000-1:2008 specification as downloaded from <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/pdf/pdf_reference.html">Adobe website</a>. The updated ISO versions can be downloaded from ISO websites. The API does not consider those versions yet. The API is developed in Julia keeping in mind the need for the file format parsing in native form. More over the object structure of PDF makes the API extend-able.</p><p>Technically,the PDFIO does not fully fit into the stream based file access APIs like <a href="https://github.com/JuliaIO/FileIO.jl">JuliaIO/FileIO</a>. However, there is a general interest to submit this API in that direction to ensure it&#39;s considered as a native file format understood by Julia.</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="About-PDF-1" href="#About-PDF-1">About PDF</a></h2><p>For people new to PDF development, PDF is a highly cross referenced file format without any specific linear location to read content. You can consider this as a form of a tree which needs to be read or understood as reading a tree. Hence, if your application demands you need not have to scan the full file format to get your job done. This is very different thinking than most file formats that are parsed from beginning to end.</p><p>The second part to remember is PDF is a derivative of a Page Description Language (PDL) like PostScript. The visual sanctity is considered most important than document structure. Although, the document structure was introduced in PDF as an afterthought a lot later, it&#39;s not core to the format. Unfortunately, the creators never focus too much on this as it&#39;s a post processing over a print stream.</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Structure-of-API-1" href="#Structure-of-API-1">Structure of API</a></h2><p>The API is segregated into 3 modules:</p><ol><li>Common</li><li>Cos</li><li>PD</li></ol><p><strong>Common</strong> module has general system access and file access and parsing APIs.</p><p><strong>Cos</strong> module is the low level file format for PDF. Carousel Object Structure was original term proposed inside Adobe which later transformed into Acrobat. Cos layer has the object structure, definition and the cross references to access them.</p><p><strong>PD</strong> module is the higher level document access layer. Accessing PDF pages or extracting the content from there or understanding document rendering using fonts or image objects will be typically in this layer. Please note that many objects in the PD layer actually refer to the Cos structure. You can consider PD Layer as the business logic while Cos Layer as the database for it.</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Intent-and-Limitations-1" href="#Intent-and-Limitations-1">Intent and Limitations</a></h2><p>The APIs are developed for text extraction as a major focus. The rendering and printing aspects of PDF are not provided enough thoughts. Secondly, a native script based language was chosen as PDF specification is highly misunderstood and interpretations significantly vary from document creator to creator. A script based language provides flexibility to fix issues as we discover more nuances in the new files we discover. Thirdly, every well-developed native library out in the market need connectors and PDF being a standard should have native support in a modern language. Although, one can claim PDF is not the most  ideal language for text processing, it&#39;s just ubiquitous and cannot be ignored.</p><p><em>Nothing stops anyone to extend this APIs into a fully developed PDF Library  that&#39;s available to both commercial as well as non-commercial licensing under a  flexible license model. I am happy to collaborate with anyone who sees value in   extending this library in that direction. MIT License looks most flexible to  the author for the time-being.</em></p><h3><a class="nav-anchor" id="Common-1" href="#Common-1">Common</a></h3><ol><li>Error handling is currently fairly weak with only errors or asserts leading</li></ol><p>to termination. Ideally, if the PDF is structurally weak, there is no point extracting content from the same. However, not all objects may be well-formed a linient approach may be taken in the PD layers.</p><h3><a class="nav-anchor" id="Cos-1" href="#Cos-1">Cos</a></h3><ol><li>Streams have larger number of filter types. Only Flate has been tested to</li></ol><p>work reasonably.</p><ol><li>Filterparms are varied and only PNG filter UP has been tested to some extent</li></ol><p>as part of ObjectStream. RLE, ACII85, ASCIIHex are tested as well. Multiple filters per stream has been tested as well.</p><ol><li>Object stream extends attribute has not been considered. May not be needed</li></ol><p>for a reader context.</p><ol><li>Free indirect objects are ignored in the PDF file as it&#39;s not typically a</li></ol><p>reader requirement.</p><ol><li>No security is implemented for encrypted PDFs</li></ol><h3><a class="nav-anchor" id="PD-1" href="#PD-1">PD</a></h3><ol><li>PD layer is just barely developed for reading pages and extracting contents</li></ol><p>from it.</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Reference-to-Adobe-1" href="#Reference-to-Adobe-1">Reference to Adobe</a></h2><p>It&#39;s almost impossible to talk PDF without reference to Adobe. All copyrights or trademarks are that are owned by Adobe or ISO, which have been referred to inadvertently without stating ownership, are owned by them. The author also has been part of Adobe&#39;s development culture in early part of his career with specific to PDF technology for about 2 years. However, the author has not been part of any activities related to PDF development from 2003. Hence, this API can  be considered a clean room development. Usage of words like  Carousel and Cos are pretty much public knowledge and large number of reference  to the same can be obtained from industry related websites etc.</p><p>The package contains <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/font.html">Adobe Font Metrics (AFM)</a> for 14 Core Adobe fonts. </p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Test-files-1" href="#Test-files-1">Test files</a></h2><p>Not all PDF files that were used to test the library has been owned by the author. Hence, the author cannot make those files available to general public for distribution under the source code license. However, the author is grateful to the PDF document <a href="http://www.stillhq.com/pdfdb/db.html">library</a> maintained by <a href="mikal@stillhq.com">mikal@stillhq.com</a>. However, these files are no longer available in the link above. </p><p>Some files are also included from <a href="https://github.com/openpreserve/format-corpus/tree/master/pdfCabinetOfHorrors">openpreserve</a>. These files can be distributed with <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0</a>.</p><p>However, test files may have different licensing that the <code>PDFIO</code>. Hence we have now uploaded most test files to another project under <a href="https://github.com/sambitdash/PDFTest">PDFTest</a>.</p><footer><hr/><a class="next" href="../"><span class="direction">Next</span><span class="title">API Structure and Design</span></a></footer></article></body></html>
