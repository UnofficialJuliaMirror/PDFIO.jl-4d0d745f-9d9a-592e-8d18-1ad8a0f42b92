Normally, certificate authorities (root as well as intermediate) are represented in the trust store.\nPresence of an end-entity certificate in the Trust Store ensures that the chain validation for the certificate does not have to be carried out. However, this is not considered a good practice for certificates as the certificate validation is an important attribute to avoid security breaches in the chain. In case of self-signed certificates with not CA capabilities this may be the only option. \nValidation of digital signatures are limited to the approval signature validation as per section 12.8.1 of PDF Spec. 1.7. Signatures for permissions and usage rights are not validated as per this method. This API only provides a validation report. It does not modify access to any parts of the document based on the validation output. The consumer of the API needs to take appropriate action based on the validation report as desired in their applications.\nRevocation - When time is embedded in the signature as signing-time attribute or a signed timestamp or PDF sigature dictionary has M attribute, then those are picked up for validation. However, revocation information are not used during validation.\nPDF 2.0 Support - The support is only experimental. While some subfilters like /ETSI.CAdES.detached are supported.
